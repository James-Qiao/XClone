abstract={Somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) are major mutations that contribute to the development and progression of various cancers. Despite a few computational methods proposed to detect CNAs from single-cell transcriptomic data, the technical sparsity of such data makes it challenging to identify allele-specific CNAs, particularly in complex clonal structures. In this study, we present a statistical method, XClone, that strengthens the signals of read depth and allelic imbalance by effective smoothing on cell neighborhood and gene coordinate graphs to detect haplotype-aware CNAs from scRNA-seq data. By applying XClone to multiple datasets with challenging compositions, we demonstrated its ability to robustly detect different types of allele-specific CNAs and potentially indicate whole genome duplication, therefore enabling the discovery of corresponding subclones and the dissection of their phenotypic impacts.},
