Inference of Clonal Copy Number Variation in Single Cells

XClone is an algorithm to infer allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers 
in individual cells from low-coverage and sparse single-cell RNA sequencing data 
(e.g., those generated by 10x Genomics, Smart-seq, etc.). 
The full description of the algorithm and its application on published cancer datasets are described in full-text

`XClone: detection of allele-specific subclonal copy number variations from single-cell transcriptomic data <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.03.535352v1>`_.

The demo of XClone and results on the 3 processed cancer datasets are available at
`xclone-data <https://github.com/Rongtingting/xclone-data>`_.


Please frequently read the `tutorials and release history <https://xclone-cnv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and keep software up to date since XClone is being updated 
and improved frequently at this stage.

Installation
============

Main Module
-----------

XClone requires Python 3.7 (recommend 3.7 for stable performance). 
We recommend to use Anaconda environment for version control and to avoid potential conflicts::

    conda create -n xclone python=3.7
    conda activate xclone

XClone package can be conveniently installed via PyPI::

    pip install xclone

or directly from GitHub repository (for development version)::

    pip install git+https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/XClone


Preprocessing via xcltk 
-----------------------

xcltk is a toolkit for XClone preprocessing.
xcltk is avaliable through pypi. To install, type the following command line, and add -U for upgrading::

    pip install -U xcltk

Alternatively, you can install from this GitHub repository for latest (often development) version by following command line::

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/hxj5/xcltk
